We commence this thesis by introducing a selection/assortment of fundamental notations, definitions, and results that will be employed throughout. Following this, a concise overview of key results regarding vector spaces and vector spaces of functions is presented. It is important to note that these sections do not delve deeply into these topics; for thorough coverage, the reader is referred to the primary sources of this chapter \cite{heilMetricsNormsInner2018,heilIntroductionRealAnalysis2019}. The chapter concludes with a short discussion of the terminology and notation employed alongside the exponential and indicator functions.

We let $\N$ denote the set of positive integers $\braq{1,2,3, \dots}$, $\Z$ denote the set of all integers $\braq{\dots, -1,0,1, \dots}$, and $\R$ and $\C$ to denote the set of all real and complex numbers respectively. Furthermore, we denote by $I^d = \bras{0,1}^d$ the \emph{$d$-dimensionial unit cube} in $\R^d$, sometimes referred to as the \emph{unit hypercube} or simply the \emph{unit cube}. These terms will be used interchangeably, and unless the dimension is specified in the context, it will mean the $d$-dimensional cube. Note that the letter $d$ always refers to the dimension and \emph{vice versa}.
