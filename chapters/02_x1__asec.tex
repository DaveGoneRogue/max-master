\begin{definition}[Span]\label{def:span}  %? Page 159, chapter 4, Heil metrics norms
    Let $E$ be a subset of a vector space $X$. The \emph{finite linear span}, or \emph{span} for short, is the set of all finite linear combinations of $E$, that is
    \begin{equation*}
        \spn{E}=\braqMed{\sum_{n=1}^N C_n v_n : N \in \N, v_n \in E, C_i \in \C}.
    \end{equation*}
    We say that $E$ \emph{spans} $X$ if $\spn{E} = X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Closure]\label{def:closure}  %? Page 66, chapter 2, Heil metrics norms
    Let $X$ be an arbitrary set. Given a subset $E \subseteq X$, the \emph{closure} of $E$, denoted $\overline{E}$, is the smallest closed set containing $E$. The closure is expressed as the intersection of all closed sets containing $E$,
    \begin{equation*}
        \overline{E} = \bigcap \braqMed{F \subseteq X : F \text{ closed, and } E \subseteq F}. \qedhere
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
If $\overline{E} = X$ then we say that $E$ is \emph{dense} in $X$. Also, if $E$ is closed, then $\overline{E}=E$. In this regard, note that any intersection of closed sets is closed, implying that $\overline{E}$ is closed.
\begin{remark} %? Page 67, chapter 2, Heil metrics norms, proof can also be found here
    If $E$ is a subset of a metric space $X$, then
    \begin{equation*} % can also use $n \in \N$ notation here for the sequence
        \overline{E} = \{ y \in X : \exists \space \bracMed{y_n}_{n\in \N} \subseteq E \quad \text{ s.t }\quad y_n \longrightarrow y\}.
    \end{equation*}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Closed Span]\label{def:closed_span}  %? Page 159, chapter 4, Heil metrics norms
    Let $E$ be a subset of a normed space $X$. The \emph{closed linear span} or \emph{closed span} of $E$ is the closure of $\spn{E}$, that is
    \begin{equation*}
        \spnclosMed{E} = \braqMed{y\in X: \exists \space \bracMed{y_n}_{n\in \N} \subseteq \spn{E} \quad \text{ s.t } \quad y_n \longrightarrow y}. \qedhere
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Complete]\label{def:complete}  %? Page 160, chapter 4, Heil metrics norms
    Let $E$ be a subset of a normed space $X$. If $\spnclos{E} = X$, meaning, $\spn{E}$ is dense in $X$ with respect to the \GenNormX, then we say that $E$ is \emph{complete} in $X$.  %, \emph{fundamental}, or \emph{total}.
\end{definition}

%! On the matter of sequence notation v.s. Element of notation. It seems that Heil's definition on page 159 allows for the option that it is a sequence.
%! and on page 67, they make no mention of the fact that it can be a sequence.
%? Solved, writing y_n without sequence notation can be interpreted as we are looking at "one element", and not a bunch of elements which we have from the sum
%? in the definition of the span
