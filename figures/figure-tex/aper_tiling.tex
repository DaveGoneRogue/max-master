    \caption{Illustrated in FIG:A is the initial lattice tiling $\Lambda$, and illustrated in FIG:B is the constructed aperiodic tiling $\widetilde{\Lambda}$ after translation of $\upsilon'$ and $\upsilon''$. The latter figure also shows that there can be no more than four unit cubes from the shifted columns in a $2\times 2\times 2$ block of cubes. }
