  abstract = {Throughout history, geometric patterns have formed an important part of art and ornamental design. Today we have unprecedented ability to understand ornamental styles of the past, to recreate traditional designs, and to innovate with new interpretations of old styles and with new styles altogether. The power to further the study and practice of ornament stems from three sources. We have new mathematical tools: a modern conception of geometry that enables us to describe with precision what designers of the past could only hint at. We have new algorithmic tools: computers and the abstract mathematical processing they enable allow us to perform calculations that were intractable in previous generations. Finally, we have technological tools: manufacturing devices that can turn a synthetic description provided by a computer into a real-world artifact. Taken together, these three sets of tools provide new opportunities for the application of computers to the analysis and creation of ornament. In this dissertation, I present my research in the area of computer-generated geometric art and ornament. I focus on two projects in particular. First I develop a collection of tools and methods for producing traditional Islamic star patterns. Then I examine the tesselations of M. C. Escher, developing an ``Escherization'' algorithm that can derive novel Escher-like tesselations of the plane from arbitrary user-supplied shapes. Throughout, I show how modern mathematics, algorithms, and technology can be applied to the study of these ornamental styles.},

  abstract = {"Quasicrystals are non-periodic solids that were discovered in 1982 by Dan Shechtman, Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry 2011. The underlying mathematics, known as the theory of aperiodic order, is the subject of this comprehensive multi-volume series. This first volume provides a graduate-level introduction to the many facets of this relatively new area of mathematics. Special attention is given to methods from algebra, discrete geometry and harmonic analysis, while the main focus is on topics motivated by physics and crystallography. In particular, the authors provide a systematic exposition of the mathematical theory of kinematic diffraction. Numerous illustrations and worked-out examples help the reader to bridge the gap between theory and application. The authors also point to more advanced topics to show how the theory interacts with other areas of pure and applied mathematics"--Publisher description},

The conjecture is false for this dimension if and only if at least one of the graphs contains a clique of size \$2\^7 = 128\$. We present an automated method to solve this conjecture by encoding the existence of such a clique as a propositional formula. We apply satisfiability solving combined with symmetry-breaking techniques to determine that no such clique exists. This result implies that every unit cube tiling of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^7\$ contains a facesharing pair of cubes. Since a faceshare-free unit cube tiling of \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^8\$ exists (which we also verify), this completely resolves Keller's conjecture.},

While this conjecture remains open on                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash mathbb R\}\^1\$                                               , there are many results in the literature that discuss the relations among various forms of the Fuglede conjecture on                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash mathbb Z\}\_n\$                                               ,                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash mathbb Z\}\$                                               and                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash mathbb R\}\^1\$                                               and also the seemingly stronger universal tiling (spectrum) conjectures on the respective groups. In this paper, we clarify the equivalences between these statements in dimension one. In addition, we show that if the Fuglede conjecture on                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash mathbb R\}\^1\$                                               is true, then every spectral set with rational measure must have a rational spectrum. We then investigate the Coven\textendash Meyerowitz property for finite sets of integers, introduced in [               1               ], and we show that if the spectral sets and the tiles in                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash mathbb Z\}\$                                               satisfy the Coven\textendash Meyerowitz property, then both sides of the Fuglede conjecture on                                                                      \$\{\textbackslash mathbb R\}\^1\$                                               are true.},

  abstract = {We examine Fourier frames and, more generally, frame measures for different probability measures. We prove that if a measure has an associated frame measure, then it must have a certain uniformity in the sense that the weight is distributed quite uniformly on its support. To be more precise, by considering certain absolute continuity properties of the measure and its translation, we recover the characterization on absolutely continuous measures g dx with Fourier frames obtained in [24]. Moreover, we prove that the frame bounds are pushed away by the essential infimum and supremum of the function g. This also shows that absolutely continuous spectral measures supported on a set {$\Omega$}, if they exist, must be the standard Lebesgue measure on {$\Omega$} up to a multiplicative constant. We then investigate affine iterated function systems (IFSs), we show that if an IFS with no overlap admits a frame measure then the probability weights are all equal. Moreover, we also show that the \L aba\textendash Wang conjecture [20] is true if the self-similar measure is absolutely continuous. Finally, we will present a new approach to the conjecture of Liu and Wang [29] about the structure of non-uniform Gabor orthonormal bases of the form G(g, {$\Lambda$}, J ).},

  abstract = {In his paper Theory of Communication [Gab46], D. Gabor proposed the use of a family of functions obtained from one Gaussian by time-and frequency shifts. Each of these is well concentrated in time and frequency; together they are meant to constitute a complete collection of building blocks into which more complicated time-depending functions can be decomposed. The application to communication proposed by Gabor was to send the coeffi cients of the decomposition into this family of a signal, rather than the signal itself. This remained a proposal-as far as I know there were no seri ous attempts to implement it for communication purposes in practice, and in fact, at the critical time-frequency density proposed originally, there is a mathematical obstruction; as was understood later, the family of shifted and modulated Gaussians spans the space of square integrable functions [BBGK71, Per71] (it even has one function to spare [BGZ75] ...) but it does not constitute what we now call a frame, leading to numerical insta bilities. The Balian-Low theorem (about which the reader can find more in some of the contributions in this book) and its extensions showed that a similar mishap occurs if the Gaussian is replaced by any other function that is "reasonably" smooth and localized. One is thus led naturally to considering a higher time-frequency density},

The product of at most three primes as the order of the cyclic group was studied intensely in the last couple of years. In this paper we study the case when the order of the cyclic group is the product of four different primes and prove that Fuglede's conjecture holds in this case.},

  abstract = {A set \$\textbackslash Omega \textbackslash subset \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ is said to be spectral if the space \$L\^2(\textbackslash Omega)\$ has an orthogonal basis of exponential functions. A conjecture due to Fuglede (1974) stated that \$\textbackslash Omega\$ is a spectral set if and only if it can tile the space by translations. While this conjecture was disproved for general sets, it has long been known that for a convex body \$\textbackslash Omega \textbackslash subset \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ the "tiling implies spectral" part of the conjecture is in fact true. To the contrary, the "spectral implies tiling" direction of the conjecture for convex bodies was proved only in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^2\$, and also in \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^3\$ under the a priori assumption that \$\textbackslash Omega\$ is a convex polytope. In higher dimensions, this direction of the conjecture remained completely open (even in the case when \$\textbackslash Omega\$ is a polytope) and could not be treated using the previously developed techniques. In this paper we fully settle Fuglede's conjecture for convex bodies affirmatively in all dimensions, i.e. we prove that if a convex body \$\textbackslash Omega \textbackslash subset \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ is a spectral set then \$\textbackslash Omega\$ is a convex polytope which can tile the space by translations. To prove this we introduce a new technique, involving a construction from crystallographic diffraction theory, which allows us to establish a geometric "weak tiling" condition necessary for a set \$\textbackslash Omega \textbackslash subset \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^d\$ to be spectral.},
