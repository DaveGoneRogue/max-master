We note the distinction between non-periodic and aperiodic. 
Every aperiodic tiles non-periodic; however, not all non-periodic tilings can also tile aperiodically. 



Non-periodic tiling means that there is no period parallelogram.  
Worth emphasizing is the fact that we lack a method for determining whether a tile is the prototile of a monohedral tiling. 
Also, one can have tilings with no periods at all. However, it is very different "to ask" for tiles that are aperiodic, i.e., 
for tiles that can tile but only in a way that admits no periods. In fact, the answer to this question is not known if we insist that only 
translations are allowed. (One has allowed translation etc., see more on this below)



It is these three motions that in literature often exhibit interesting behavior \cite{kolountzakisTilingsTranslation2010}. 
This latter is the last one of the \emph{group of rigid motions} of the Euclidean group one usually considers in tilings. %* Fant bare wikipedia kilde her
Last, in addition to translation and rotation, one can have reflections \cite{kolountzakisTilingsTranslation2010}. 
An example of this can be seen in \cref{fig:tiling_four}, where a reflected tile is also used.

%* Important distinction between reflection symmetry and tiling by reflection (AND translation!)
The first can clearly be found in the Penrose figure with reflection LINES passing through the middle. 
Tilings by reflection use a reflected variant of the tile in addition to the "normal" tile AND then use translation to cover the surface. 
Sometimes one also needs to rotate in addition in order to cover the entire surface. 
Think about the examples on page 35/36 in \cite{grunbaumTilingsPatterns1987}


Note that one would be hard-pressed to find a reflection line in the aperiodic tiling of \cref{fig:tiling_two}; however, reflection lines exist for 
individual fragments of the tiling. DETTE ER FEIL! Fant refleksjonslinje på figuren vist.

The full group of rigid motions is a subgroup of the Euclidian group https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_group
translation, rotation $\subset$ translation, rotation, reflection

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aperiodic_sets_of_tiles
The tilings obtained from an aperiodic set of tiles are often called aperiodic tilings, though strictly speaking, it is the tiles themselves 
that are aperiodic. (The tiling itself is said to be "nonperiodic.")
